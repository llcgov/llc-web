Fernan Bridge.  The City of Lapu-Lapu and Municipality of Cordova comprises the whole Mactan Island.  These are connected by two bridges,   bound from Suba-Basbas, the Suba-Basbas-Gabi bridge and bound from Babag, the Babag-Pilipog bridge.  Her proximity to a highly developed area which is Cebu City has resulted in a mutually reinforcing relationship.

                        The other side of the island facing Cebu, has no sandy shores.  The deep harbors, however along this coast has made it the ideal location for the oil companies, for ship-building repair, dry-docking industry, for the construction of the giant industrial complex of General Milling Corporation and for the various industries of the Mactan Economic Zone.       
                        Ferry boat service is also available between Pier 3 in Cebu City and Muelle Osmeña, Poblacion, The City of Lapu-Lapu.
                        It is expected that more industrial establishments will move to The City of Lapu-Lapu considering the convenience she can offer to investors plus the services extended by the industries located in the Mactan Export Processing Zone (MEPZ I & II) and Cebu Lightt Industries Park (CLIP).
